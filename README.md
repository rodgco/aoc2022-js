# Advent of Code 2022 - Typescript

Let's save Christmas again!!!

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2022) is a great opportunity to exercise my developer skills. This year trying to use Typescript to save Christmas.

## Tools

To help me I'm using the following tools:

* [Prettier](http://prettier.io) - An opinionated code formatter
* [@aocjs/cli](https://aocjs.github.io/) - Advent of Code command line tool. Supports JavaScript and TypeScript
* [PNPM](http://pnpm.io) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager

## Installation

* Clone the repository
* `pnpm i`
* Configure @aocjs/cli as described at their [site](https://aocjs.github.io)
* `pnpm start dayN` - Where N is the day you're solving

| Happy Coding!!!
